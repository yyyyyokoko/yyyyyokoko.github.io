											<h2> When Data Science Meets Broadway</h4>
											<p>This data analysis project focus on analyzing the gross and economic impact of broadway shows. I worked in a group and build this project from scratch including collecting and clean multiple data sources, exploring associations among shows and reviews, and building predictive models to further discover relationships between sales and social media reactions. We also performed some NLP tasks like topic modeling and sentiment analysis to better understand the trends of shows.

											<h2>Winer of 2019 ASA DataFest at Penn State University</h4>
											<p> I participated in the ASA 2019 DataFest last spring to improve the game performance of Canadian Rugby team. We have the data that includes the survey about fatigue level of each player, game data, and the physical conditions of players. Since the survey data could be biased based on each player’s feelings, so I standardized and normalized the data. 
												Our team constructed the clusters and correlation heat map to evaluate the features that contribute the most to the score. We found out the game day morning fatigue and irritability and game day speed are the most important features, and it’s something we want to predict. So I built a random forest model and measured the feature importance. 
												We suggested that the coaches should provide more mental helps to decrease negative thoughts, and they could also cut down the practice 5 days in advance of a game to improve the game performance. I really enjoyed this intense competition where I could brainstorm with the team and deliver something valuable. 
												I am very proud that our team received the first place of the competition and we were able to present to the representatives, whom would report to the coaches and possibly improve the game outcomes with our recommendations.

											<h2>Best Visualization of 2018 ASA DataFest at Penn State University</h4>
											<p>I participated in 2018 America Statistical Association(ASA) DataFest to give employers and students a closer and more detailed view of job markets on indeed.com. The data attributes included posting date, job age, location, category, industry, salary and clicks of a job. We focused on assisting students to better understand the career situation of their fields of studying by analyzing the popularity of jobs and industries. 
												First of all, we came up with an “interesting rate” parameter which is measured by number of clicks and job age, then compared it with number of jobs available in the market to generate the supply and demand graph. Secondly, we matched the categories and the industries that providing the jobs to inform students the type of companies they should look for a job. 
												I was highly participated in all the discussions throughout and worked my best to generate useful results. I was mainly responsible for data analyzing and visualization. I used R to extract samples, clean data, analyze data, and generate graphs. In order to help students better understand, I created multiple visualizations including Sankey diagram, scatter graph and time series to demonstrate the results. 
												It turned out our team won the best visualization award. I barely slept in 48 hours and spent my entire weekend with my teammates to strive for the best outcomes. Even though the process was tiring, I was very glad I engaged in this event. I got a chance to experience with real-world data and enjoyed the feeling of achievement when we delivered some helpful results to students.
